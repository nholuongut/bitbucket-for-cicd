This is the repository for Bitbucket for CI/CD.

<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have an understanding of Git, Atlassian accounts, and Bitbucket basics.</p>

<p>This course, led by Michael Jenkins, guides you through using Bitbucket Pipelines for your software projects. You'll gain a solid understanding of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) as you prepare to leverage Bitbucket Pipelines in these processes. We'll then dive into the details of configuring Pipelines and challenge you to create workflows using custom images, services, and artifacts.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
